# STEPS
*** Make Sure prerequisites are installed***

1.Clone the repository into desktop

```
git clone https://github.com/Salmandabbakuti/IoT-and-Blockchain.git
```

2. Install required PiP dependencies

```pip install requirements.txt```

3.Instantiate Ganache-cli Private Network.

4.Run app

```python app.py```

##### Running from Remote network(gochain):

** make sure you modifed ```appRemote.py``` with account private key and have some go tokens in it **
